### GCSudoCommand

A practice plugin that brings `sudo` command into Grasscutter private servers.

Currently, no restrictions on the usage of `sudo`, it simply dangerously runs everything unchecked directly on the server, bypassing permission mechanism.

For test use only, do not apply this plugin to public servers.


### Example

```
/sudo give @uid 203 x100
/sudo give 203 x100
/sudo shutdown
/sudo permission @uid clear
...
```

### Version

The plugin template is currently on Grasscutter version `dev-1.4.5`.
